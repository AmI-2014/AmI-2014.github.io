The idea of the project consists in preventing the user from leaving the room forgetting important objects such as wallet, phone, keys and similar objects. Everyone can benefit of the system because it exploits low cost hardware and doesn't require any direct interaction.

When the user is leaving the room, the system can detect if he's not carrying some important object and warns him in multiple ways. It can also check presence of the objects when the user gets back in the room.

The system can warn the user on ad-hoc devices or on smart devices such as smartphone or smart watches.
