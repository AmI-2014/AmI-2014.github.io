DENA is a transparent system that automatically adjusts microphone volume and light intensity in a room. DENA guarantees optimal condition with a really small effort by the talker. 
It mainly suits medium or large rooms like classrooms or conference rooms and adapt itself instantly to match the different environment conditions. 
The primary users, the talkers, can simply speak and let DENA decide the volume and the light intensity or can decide to modify the behavior of the system with a simple interface. 
How? It is possible to switch to manual control, or they can decide to record the speech, turn on or turn off the speakers and/or the lights and decide which are the correct sound or light levels that Dena will have to mantain. 
All the secondary users (the listeners) have to do is to enjoy the conference or the lesson.
