What if you could come home to a comfortable and warm environment?
What if you could forget about controlling your home's heating system?
What if you cut down your energy bill without doing anything?
What if you never run into a cold shower again?
What if could wake up to a hot cup of coffee?
What if you could buy a product that did all this and more for you?

At PiSquared&copy; we have worked hard to ensure our customers find more than what they are looking for.
SRO knows what and when
SRO controls desired appliances when you need them without you having to move a finger. Yes, it's that simple. You can sit back, relax and enjoy life while SRO does the tedious things you would rather not do.
Lowering the temperature at night to save energy, turning on the shower's heating system in the morning, the coffee machine, the TV, the alarm when you're gone... are all things of the past.
