Smart notifications are reminders for the users of the system to help them keep track of several activities to do, places to go to and events to attend. It can sometimes be difficult to remember all of these duties due to the fact that many of these notifications reside on different platforms that are not integrated with each other. Our Smart Notifications system aims at providing an efficient way to solve this issue!
