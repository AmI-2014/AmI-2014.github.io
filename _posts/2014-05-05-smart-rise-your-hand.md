We want to provide to the LADISPE a smart system able to manage the help requests of the students. What happens:

The system recognizes the hand raised and assures the reservation for getting help from the tutor.
How it happens:

* Sensing: A webcam, placed on every workstation, sends continuously images to a program able to perceive the raising hand gesture. When a student needs help he rises his hand, until the gesture perception will be notified to him.
* Reservation: The request is sent to a priority queue manager running on a Raspberry Pi.
* Communication: The manager notifies the tutors of the next student to whom provide help, through a smartwatch or a smartphone.
* Smart Management: The queue is managed in a intelligent way to optimize resources."
