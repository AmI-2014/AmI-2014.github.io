Smart Gardener is a project that would allow you to enjoy plants while lifting you from the task of watering them. It would also optimize resources by avoiding watering if rainfall is forecast in the near future or if the day will not be particularly hot. Feedback from the plants allows to tailor irrigation cycles to their specific needs without manual input.
